# Upgrading the App

Here you will find any steps necessary to upgrade the App in your Nautobot environment.

## Upgrade Nautobot 1.X to Nautobot 2.X

As part of the upgrade for Nautobot 2.0 it is recommended to perform a stepped upgrade by first upgrading Nautobot the lastest stable release within these constraints `>=1.6.2,<2.0.0`. After performing the initial upgrade of Nautobot you will need to run `nautobot-server populate_platform_network_driver --no-use-napalm-driver-field`. This will populate the `network_driver` attribute on Platform objects from the `slug` field.

## Upgrade Guide

When a new release comes out it may be necessary to run a migration of the database to account for any changes in the data models used by this plugin. Execute the command `nautobot-server post-upgrade` within the runtime environment of your Nautobot installation after updating the `nautobot-firewall-models` package via `pip`.
